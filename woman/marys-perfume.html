  <h1>Mary's Perfume</h1>

<p class="center">
  
<a href="../woman.html"><em>She</em> </a>did not wait for tomb or stone, </br>
but came while breath was still her own.</br>
With tender hands and silent grace,</br>
she touched His feet, not His face.
</p><p class="center">
A vial broke — the room was filled</br>
with <a href="../love.html">sweetness</a> none could bottle or build.</br>
She spoke no word, but love was there,</br>
in <a href="../love/ever-adore-thee.html">perfume rising through the air</a>.
</p><p class="center">
Judas scolded, silver-eyed,</br>
but love had nothing left to hide.</br>
The cost was high — and gladly spent;</br>
her heart, her oil, her worship went.
</p><p class="center">
<em>The Song</em> had said: His name is poured,</br>
like fragrant oil the soul adored.</br>
And so she poured — and so He knew:</br>
a crown of scent, before the dew.
</p><p class="center">
Let others wait till death has come —</br>
she crowned Him early, and was done.</br>
And now her name, like perfume rare,</br>
still lingers soft upon the air.
